# Goldrush API Documentation Reference

When working with API endpoints, especially those related to blockchain data, cryptocurrency analysis, or portfolio tracking, always reference the **Goldrush API Documentation** as the primary source of information.

## Key Guidelines:

1. **API Endpoint Questions**: When users ask about API endpoints, parameters, response formats, or integration details, refer to the official Goldrush API documentation first.

2. **Covalent API Integration**: The Goldrush API appears to be based on or related to Covalent's blockchain data API. Use Covalent's documentation as a reference for:
   - Portfolio endpoints (`/portfolio_v2/`)
   - Transfer endpoints (`/transfers_v2/`)
   - Block data endpoints (`/block_v2/`)
   - Authentication methods
   - Rate limiting and pagination

3. **Common Endpoints to Reference**:
   - Portfolio analysis: `/{chain}/address/{address}/portfolio_v2/`
   - Token transfers: `/{chain}/address/{address}/transfers_v2/`
   - Block information: `/{chain}/block_v2/{block_height}/`

4. **Documentation Priority**: When providing API-related guidance:
   - First: Check official Goldrush/Covalent API documentation
   - Second: Reference existing code examples in the codebase
   - Third: Provide general best practices for API integration

5. **Code Examples**: When showing API usage examples, ensure they align with the current implementation patterns seen in the development notebook, such as proper authentication headers and parameter formatting.

## Current Implementation Context:
Based on the development notebook, the project uses:
- Bearer token authentication
- EUR as quote currency
- Pagination handling for large datasets
- Error handling with retry logic
- VectorBT for portfolio backtesting

Always verify any API suggestions against the official documentation to ensure accuracy and current best practices.
