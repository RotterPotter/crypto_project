1. DB:
 - Adresses table (selected: bool)
LOOP
2. Wallet data extraction.
3. Wallet analysis.
<!-- 3. Portfolio backtesting (vectorbt). - save in db -->
4. Label in db validated.
5. Automate copy trading.

What wallet data can I extract?
  - tsx history with dates, value, etc...

With that info I can see at which price wallet bought a coin, and at which price sold.
So, I can see his pnl on each trade.
